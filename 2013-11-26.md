+ Conditional intensity in ETAS model, not in MDA model
+ u is fixed, M is magnitude, and tau varies
+ For a particular value of u, can look at area under the curve, find u such that area in error diagram is minimized
+ Threshold value for M
+ Short alarms from high magnitude earthquakes
+ As you sweep down the error curve, have longer alarms for bigger events and gradually start turning on alarms for smaller events
+ Median waiting time for first, second, third, etc.
+ Threshold for when turn on alarm at all, have threshold vary as well depending on space we want to carry; this would introduce one more parameter
+ Turn on alarms for higher magnitudes than turn on alarm for smaller magnitudes
