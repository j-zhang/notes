###Questionnaire:

#####group-1
+ analyzed: learning style (learning), where did you gain experience in the languages (personal)
+ curation in python, data analysis in R, visualization in python, presented in iPython Notebook
+ takeaways: comfortable being specialist versus comfort being generalist, the two types of people working together 

#####group-2
+ analyzed: learning style, any relationship between how people learn and roles they take on in groups
+ focused on reproducibility and consistency in coding
+ takeaways: collaboration and passing tasks along

#####group-3
+ analyzed: technical lead
+ reproducibility around code in visualization python, so went back to R for reproducibility
+ dotchart
+ roadblocks: communication 

#####group-4
+ curation in python, removed data that wasn't there
+ roadblock, need to run VM
+ saw no relationship between learning styles
+ takeaways: groupwork, stepping up, maybe students didn't know how to fill out the survey
  + had suggestions around technical leads in each group

#####group-5
+ data, information, insight

#####group-6
+ focused on reproducibility
+ roadblock with tilda ~, having trouble transferring between group members
+ analyzed: learning style and role
+ how likely someone is going to be an administrator based on learning style

#####group-7
+ analyzed: learning style and where learned
+ curated in python then analysis in R
+ all possible learning styles and used pairwise t-tests, no significant differences
+ violin plots and heatmap
+ work in distributed fashion

#####group-8
+ learning preferences (learning style), known computer languages
+ curation in python, analysis in R, visualization in R
+ major roadblocks and resolutions

#####group-9
+ pie chart of programming proficiencies
+ abstract processes away
+ roadblocks of being short a member and figuring out how to proceed

#####group-10
+ pie chart and word cloud of programming languages
+ any correlation between learning styles and languages
+ didn't meet in person

#####group-11
+ perfection is the enemy
+ everyone got their feet wet in the various stages
+ notions of collaboration and reproducibility
+ reproducibility can be in different parts and also with instructions
