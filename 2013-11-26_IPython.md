+ Computing is the backbone of science, become pervasive
+ Scientists have less well defined problem, exploratory
+ Environment to rearrange, constantly change, interactive environment
+ Rich ecosystem of Python
+ Open * (i.e. Open source, open education, open hardware, open access, etc.)
+ Computational research / computational scientists
+ Life cycle: individual exploratory work, collaborative development, parallel production runs, publication with reproducible results, education, go back to individual exploratory work
+ REPL (read-eval-print loop)
+ Complete copy of the environment
+ Tools built in collaborative and open manner by undergrads, grads, post-docs, PhDs, etc.
