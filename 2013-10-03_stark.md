#####Stochastic models for seismicity:
+ Processes in space and time, modeling location and event in time
+ Marked stochastic process - event has occurred some place in time and space, with a label such as magnitude
+ Poisson (spatially heterogeneous, temporally heterogeneous, marked)
  + Exponential process is memoryless (used for semiconductors)
+ Epidemic type after shock (ETAS)
  + Event can have many children, each children only one parent
+ Brownian passage time

#####USGS 1999 Forecast
Stage 1
+ Tried to make a big map of all the faults in the area
+ How much the ground is moving
+ Map the faults and segments of faults, identify segments with slip rates greater than or equal to 1 mm/y
+ Paleoseismic data
+ Determine for each segment a slip factor - extent to which long-term slip on fault segment is accommodated aseismically
+ For each seismic source, find expected magnitude
+ Repeat the process 2,000 times for 2,000 models, each satisfying slip constraint
+ Using historical events 

+ Generate 2,000 models; estimate long-term seismicity rates as a function of magnitude for each seismic source

Stage 2
+ Fit 3 types of stochastic models
+ Try to model how stress gets redistributed
+ None of standard interpretations of probability applies

#####Earthquake probability is a metaphor
+ The urn model for earthquakes is an assumption
+ Randomness comes from the random selection

#####Testing Predictions
+ Model earthquakes as being stochastic
+ Analogy to weather prediction
  + Clustering
+ How should we test earthquake predictions?
+ Is there a permutation-based approach to test predictions that doesn't require modeling?
+ Null: predictions are no better than chance
  + Predicionts no better than we could do with a simple method
+ Potential test statistic: parimutuel payoff
  + Comes from horse racing
