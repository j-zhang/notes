Eric Berlow: Simplifying complexity

http://www.ted.com/talks/eric_berlow_how_complexity_leads_to_simplicity.html

+ Complex doesn't always equal complicated
+ Simple power of good visualization tools, and ask questions
+ Focus on entirety and then hone in on sphere of influence, often local (one to two nodes / degrees away)
+ Stepping back and embrace complexity, more likely to find simple answer, often different from the simple answer started with
+ Simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity
