Magnitude-Dependent Automatic Alarms
Intro
+ Rabbit-Hat Theorem (you can't borrow a rabbit from an empty hat)
+ What would make the casino metaphor apt?
+ 1. the physics of earthquakes must be stochastic
+ 2. stochastic models might provide a compact, accurate description of earthquake phenomenology
+ 3. stochastic models might be useful for predicting future seismicity

Description
+ Seismicity models
  + Poisson, Poisson for "declustered" catalogs, Gamma renewal, ETAS are common stochastic models for seismicity
  + + physics doesn't justify using poisson, data rejects poisson, data still rejects even after declustering 
  + gamma renewal and ETAS model not adequately describe the data

Predictions
+ automatic alarms and MDAs
  + automatic alarm
  + magnitude-dependent automatic alarm
  + for both, adjust fraction of time covered by alarms through tau
  + optimal ETAS predictor: level set of conditional intensity
